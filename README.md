# project-t04-youtubevoice

We are attemping to answer the question: What if Prof H. had a russian female accent? Youtube Voice is a Chrome extension that is able to read youtube subtitles and convert them into an actual voice, which is generated by text-to-speech. This way, you can listen to normally silent subtitled videos or change the voice of whoever is speaking. We plan to add the ability to customize the voice, i.e. changing the accent, pitch, language, etc. Eventually we could utilize A.I. to further customize the voice to mimic famous people and characters.

# User roles

As of right now, we anticipate there being only one type of user. This is just a standard user of the extension that seeks to add voice to a video. Since there is no potential for spam or adding any content of any sort and for the sake of ease of access, we do not have any permissions.

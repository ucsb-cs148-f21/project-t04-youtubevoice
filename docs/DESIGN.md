# Browser Extension that provides  the voice changes options of videos in Youtube.


## Desgin process 

Summarizing important team decisions referring to specific meetings logged in your GitHub repo.

## Project Description
We are attempting to answer the question: What if Prof H. had a Russian female accent? Youtube Voice is a Chrome extension that is able to read youtube subtitles and convert them into an actual voice, which is generated by text-to-speech. This way, you can listen to normally silent subtitled videos or change the voice of whoever is speaking. We plan to add the ability to customize the voice, i.e. changing the accent, pitch, language, etc. Eventually we could utilize A.I. to further customize the voice to mimic famous people and characters.


## User Flow

Assuming a user has opened the video they want to watch, they can start Youtube Voice like any other Chrome extension: in the top right corner. Once opened, a user can either begin speech synthesis using the default voice by clicking the play button, or go to the settings page to customize the voice in various ways (WIP). When finished customizing, they can return to the main page and press the play button to hear their preferred voice.

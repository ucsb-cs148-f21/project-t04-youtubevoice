# Browser Extension that provides  the voice changes options of videos in Youtube.


## Desgin process 

```sh
As our project format, the team decided to use a Chrome extension.
In Scurm meeting lecture3.md, the team decided to use Youtube API as a tool to access subtile from Youtube.
Retro 1 will include video speed control, subtitle reading, and AI voice, according to the team.
```

```sh
The team decides to create the accent control in Retro 2, figure out how to console log the background noise, 
remove the original noise, keep the background noise, and add robotic voice.
After Retro 2, the YouTube API is no longer functional.
Then, after two weeks of development, the team decides to switch from one YouTube API to another.
```

```sh
The team decides to add customizable accent control, language control in Retro 3 without background 
noise cancellation, and keep the YouTube API from destroying itself.
The team also wishes to refrain from reinventing the wheel on an individual basis, as well as from
investigating features that are too advanced for current technology.
```


## Project Description
We are attempting to answer the question: What if Prof H. had a Russian female accent? Youtube Voice is a Chrome extension that is able to read youtube subtitles and convert them into an actual voice, which is generated by text-to-speech. This way, you can listen to normally silent subtitled videos or change the voice of whoever is speaking. We plan to add the ability to customize the voice, i.e. changing the accent, pitch, language, etc. Eventually we could utilize A.I. to further customize the voice to mimic famous people and characters.


## User Flow

Assuming a user has opened the video they want to watch, they can start Youtube Voice like any other Chrome extension: in the top right corner. Once opened, a user can either begin speech synthesis using the default voice by clicking the play button, or go to the settings page to customize the voice in various ways (WIP). When finished customizing, they can return to the main page and press the play button to hear their preferred voice.




## List of basic features to implement:

Voice Transfer on YouTube Videos based on provided video-sampl.
Takes input video’s subtitle from YouTube URL and outputs a video that plays in the voice of users’ choices. 
Ancent control.
Chnge the pitch.

# Browser Extension that provides  the voice changes options of videos in Youtube.


## Desgin process 

```sh
As our project format, the team decided to use a Chrome extension.
In Scurm meeting lecture3.md, the team decided to use Youtube API as a tool to access subtile from Youtube.
Retro 1 will include video speed control, subtitle reading, and AI voice, according to the team.
```

```sh
The team decides to create the accent control in Retro 2, figure out how to console log the background noise, 
remove the original noise, keep the background noise, and add robotic voice.
After Retro 2, the YouTube API is no longer functional.
Then, after two weeks of development, the team decides to switch from one YouTube API to another.
```

```sh
The team decides to add customizable accent control, language control in Retro 3 without background 
noise cancellation, and keep the YouTube API from destroying itself.
The team also wishes to refrain from reinventing the wheel on an individual basis, as well as from
investigating features that are too advanced for current technology.
```


## Project Description
We are attempting to answer the question: What if Prof H. had a Russian female accent? Youtube Voice is a Chrome extension that is able to read youtube subtitles and convert them into an actual voice, which is generated by text-to-speech. This way, you can listen to normally silent subtitled videos or change the voice of whoever is speaking. We plan to add the ability to customize the voice, i.e. changing the accent, pitch, language, etc. Eventually we could utilize A.I. to further customize the voice to mimic famous people and characters.


## User Flow

Assuming a user has opened the video they want to watch, they can start Youtube Voice like any other Chrome extension: in the top right corner. Once opened, a user can either begin speech synthesis using the default voice by clicking the play button, or go to the settings page to customize the voice in various ways. We give users the freedom to play or pause the extension at any point in a video, and whether or not the video is paused. This way, users can pause our extension and continue playing the video. Users can also play the extension while the video is paused, and the speech synthesis will start as soon as the video is played. In addition, a user can change and update their settings regardless of whether the video or extension is playing or not. There are two sections in settings: Voice control and speech censoring. These sections have two separate update buttons so they can be updated individually. Users can change these settings or run speech synthesis at their default values, and click the back button to return to the play button, which will always reflect if a user can play or pause the extension (if the extension is playing, it will have a pause symbol, and vice versa). Users can also safely close the extension after entering their preferred settings and clicking play.

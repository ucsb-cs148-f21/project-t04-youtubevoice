Summarizing important team decisions referring to specific meetings logged in your GitHub repo.

## Project Description
We are attempting to answer the question: What if Prof H. had a Russian female accent? Youtube Voice is a Chrome extension that is able to read youtube subtitles and convert them into an actual voice, which is generated by text-to-speech. This way, you can listen to normally silent subtitled videos or change the voice of whoever is speaking. We plan to add the ability to customize the voice, i.e. changing the accent, pitch, language, etc. Eventually we could utilize A.I. to further customize the voice to mimic famous people and characters.

* Product Purpose: 
    * The purpose of this product is to maximize the users' experience while watching a YouTube video. Using the extension, a user will be able to listen to a YouTube video in an English accent of their choice. This will break the language barrier a user might face while listening to the video and enjoy the content. Also if a users finds a video that doesn’t have any audio but only captions, the users can use our extension to add a voice of that video. 
    * We are also making this extension to enhance the experience of youtube content creators and users. There are a lot of customization features like filters for photo sharing app like instagram, snapchat and others. Our extension takes this custimization idea and adds it to YouTube which otherwise lacks any customization and extravagant features for the video that is being played. We give the users to ability to customize how they want to hear the video! The idea is to customize video as much as possible so not only users who are watching a video can customize it but also creator who are making them can customize their voices before uploading it.
    * One of the purpose of this extension is also to make YouTube more fun. Just like with snapchat - no one needs a dog faced filter but everyone uses it - our extension desires to make youtube more entertaining so that users have the best time watching videos with their friends and family. The bonus is that our extension not only fulfills the desire to make youtube more interesting but also serves a necessary purpose of eliminating language barriers faced by users described below.  
* List of intended users audience:
    * Intended for people facing a language barrier while watching English videos on YouTube. 
    * As an American culinary to student, I want to change the accent of the Italian chef whose video I’m watching, so I can understand how to make pasta in an American English accent. (I don't want to watch some other 'how to make pasta video'. He is the best chef so I want to watch his video only)
    * As a English speaker, I’m listening to news from others countries like Middle East, France, India, China, etc. and I’m unable to understand the news reader’s accent, so I want to change their accent to my countries' (American/Australian/British/...) English accent to listen to the news more smoothly.
    * As someone who is bored, I want to change the accents/voice of people in YouTube videos so I can amuse myself.
    * As an aspiring content creator I'm looking for ideas to make a viral video so I want to play around with something creative and out of the box like this extension to come up with new ideas for my video. 
    * As a parent I want a feature that allows me to censor words of my choice from the videos my children are watching. 
    * Future users could be creators themselves who change their voice/pitch/rate before uploading their videos to make their videos more entertaining.

# About

My name is Haolan Li.
I am somewhat an expert at copying and pasting from Stack Overflow.
Also, I have 4 years of C++ experience and 2 years of Rust.
I can also write a full stack website from scratch.

For this project I want to learn some Javascript
(and complaining about how bad Javascript's design is).
Plus, some people do have difficulty understanding an accent so it could be useful.

My name is Hunter Massey. I am a second-year transfer student majoring in computer science. My main goal with this project is to delve into new technologies that I am inexperienced with and learn them through collaboration with my team. I think our base product should be able to take the subtitles from a Youtube video and use them to dub the video in real time with an AI generated voice. Some potential features include support for multiple languages, the ability to modify the voice (change the accent and pitch, or choose from a cast of characters), and even the ability to use the voice to read user comments.

# About me
My name is Kaleb Guo, and I'd want to introduce myself. I am a four-year college science student interested in augmented reality, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. In my spare time, I enjoy listening to music, skiing, and playing board games.

# Project Ideas

My idea for this project is to use Restful API to construct a Chrome plugin. My expectation for this project is that the web software developed by our team will be able to change the voice of original YouTube videos to sound different. I'm thinking of giving users additional sound cover options, such as female/male accents from various nations.

## Action item

* a change: setting up times to program together.

* a measurement: we can track progress on MVP to determine if the change helped.


## Optional

* Record anything else you think the team might want to remember from this retro

* Boat (Product): Video speed control, subtitle reading, AI voice 

* Wind (What is going right): Making progress toward MVP, consistent daily scrums, have a clear view of what is going on (on the right track)

* Anchor (What is holding us back): Time management, busy with other classes, lack of work assignments

* Rocks (Potential problems/risks in the future): Work imbalances, Technical problems: user changing speed on youtube video, auto generated captions won't work

* Island (End goal): Take someones voice from a youtube video and make it into a different voice

## Retro Assessment

* A brief description of what retro outline or process you used.

I used the picture of a sailboat as an artifact, which we used as an analogy for our team with various symbols that represented different topics (see above).

* A brief assessment of how it went.

I think it went fairly well, everyone contributed at least 2 points, and as the facilitator I stayed objective and impartial. The group was sometimes distracted and there were some off-topic tangents, but I think that's expected from a first retro.

* What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro
  based on what you learned today?

  Having a plan helped greatly to keep the conversation going. Try to keep everyone on topic and avoid putting blame on a single person, instead encourage thinking as a team.

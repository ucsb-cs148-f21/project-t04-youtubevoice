# Date of Retrospective: 10/13/21

* Led by: Hunter
* Present: Aditya, Haolan, Bisman, Kaleb, Hunter
* Absent: none :)

## Action item

* a goal: get better at technology (learning javascript and chrome extension stuff).

* a change: setting up times to program together.

* a measurement: we can track progress on MVP to determine if the change helped.


## Optional

* Record anything else you think the team might want to remember from this retro

* Boat (Product): Video speed control, subtitle reading, AI voice 

* Wind (What is going right): Making progress toward MVP, consistent daily scrums, have a clear view of what is going on (on the right track)

* Anchor (What is holding us back): Time management, busy with other classes, lack of work assignments

* Rocks (Potential problems/risks in the future): Work imbalances, Technical problems: user changing speed on youtube video, auto generated captions won't work

* Island (End goal): Take someones voice from a youtube video and make it into a different voice

## Retro Assessment

* A brief description of what retro outline or process you used.

I used the picture of a sailboat as an artifact, which we used as an analogy for our team with various symbols that represented different topics (see above).

* A brief assessment of how it went.

I think it went fairly well, everyone contributed at least 2 points, and as the facilitator I stayed objective and impartial. The group was sometimes distracted and there were some off-topic tangents, but I think that's expected from a first retro.

* What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro
  based on what you learned today?

  Having a plan helped greatly to keep the conversation going. Try to keep everyone on topic and avoid putting blame on a single person, instead encourage thinking as a team.
  
  ## Retro Outcome Assessment

* A brief description of what your retro experiment was

We wanted to experiment scheduling times to work/code together outside of class in groups based on what we were working on.

* A brief recap of the metric you planned on using

Our metric was our progress on our MVP, essentially how much we were able to get done.

* The outcome according to the metric now that the next Sprint is done (maybe already for a while).

We finished our MVP goal of taking subtitles and synthesising speech, so this was very successful.

* Your conclusions based on this outcome. You can decide to cement this change going forward, to modify it (start a new experiment), or to discard it and go back to previous procedures.

It was very helpful to organize ourselves into subgroups and plan work sessions. We will definitely continue doing this, and I don't think any modifications are necessary.

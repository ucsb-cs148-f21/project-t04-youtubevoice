Retro Assessment

A brief description of what retro outline or process you used.
I used the picture of a sailboat as an artifact, which we used as an analogy for our team with various symbols that represented different topics (see above).

A brief assessment of how it went.
I think it went fairly well, everyone contributed meaningful information, and as the facilitator I stayed objective and impartial. The group was sometimes distracted and there were some off-topic tangents, but I think that's expected from a first retro.

What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro based on what you learned today?

Having a plan helped greatly to keep the conversation going. Try to keep everyone on topic and avoid putting blame on a single person, instead encourage thinking as a team.

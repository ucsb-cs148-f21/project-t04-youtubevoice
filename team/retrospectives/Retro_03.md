Auto-generated subtitles now work, but the backend breaks sometimes.
Need more fallback measures.

## Retro Assessment

* A brief description of what retro outline or process you used.

We used the Start/Stop/Continue model to figure out what need to stop and what is helpful enough to keep doing.

* A brief assessment of how it went.

It went quite well, with practical suggestions for the current technical issues.
We also fixed some overly-ambitious goals.


* What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro
  based on what you learned today?

Keep it practical, but not overly specific.

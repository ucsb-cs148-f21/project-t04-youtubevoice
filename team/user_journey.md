# User Stories

* As a student, I can dub tutorials and educational videos so that I can better understand the teacher and thus the material.
* As a podcast listener, I can create a dub from subtitles so that I can listen to foreign language podcasts.
* As a content creator, I can recreate previously subtitled videos with a different voice or language so that they can reach a larger audience.
* As a Youtube viewer, I can convert the subtitles of any silent video into a voice so that I can multitask while listening to it.
